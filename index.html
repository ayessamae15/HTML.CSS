          <h3>My Adulthood</h3>
          <p>To become an adult you must achieve a separate identity. 
            Erik Erickson a Austrian psychologist defined identity as "a sense of self part from one's family.
            " This means to be an adult you must become independent so that you will be provided the opportunity
             to learn and take responsibility for your own lives. Young adults need to know who they are in order
             to be self-dependent, they also need to know their strengths and weaknesses, and the values they consider to be important to them. 
             Young people who enter the adult world with a strong understanding of who they are and obtained a strong sense of self- developing 
             in adolescence should have no problem obtaining an emotional identity that is separate from their former family. 
             There is also plenty of decision making in adulthood and you don't always have an elder to help you out. 
             You must make decisions about career goals and even personal goals you must also accept responsibility for maintaining a residence, 
             and obtaining the financial needs to support yourself. These decisions are very important because these are the decisions that you will have to live with for the rest of your life. 
             Achieving a separate identity is very important and you must be able to do so if you want to become an adult.
            Being an adult means entering the world of work. You must be able to find a job and be willing to work enough to support yourself</p>
